# NoriScript

NoriScript is an experimental TypeScript + JSX language extension designed to improve the readability, clarity, and type safety of JSX and reactive code based on getters (more popularly known as signals). Its syntax design is guided by [our language design principles](#design-principles).

> **This project is in early development.** Most core features have been designed and implemented, but substantial tooling work remains before the extension is fully usable. 
<!-- To get a sense of the syntax, explore these [code glimpses](#code-glimpse) and [examples](). -->

## Motivation

Reactive UI programming and JSX have both been game changers in web development, turning complex UI updates into simple view bindings. However, JavaScript variables are not natively reactive, and existing solutions to making them reactive have their caveats. What initially seems simple and elegant often creates downstream complexity, conceptual overhead, and/or performance issues through implicit behaviors that are inconsistent with native JavaScript semantics or patterns.

Accessor functions, popularized in the form of signals by Solid.js, show real promise as an explicit, performant conduit to reactivity in JavaScript. Unfortunately, accessors have their own set of caveats, such as opaqueness to TypeScript type guards, the visual clutter of function calls, or confusion caused by functions with data variable names.

Meanwhile, JSX, though elegant in its syntactic rules, can quickly become unwieldy and difficult to parse when expressing complex and stateful dynamic views.

NoriScript proposes to address these caveats with a dash of syntactic sugar.

<!-- ## Code Examples -->

<!-- Check out [code glimpses]() and [demos]() on [NoriScript's site](https://noriscript.org).  -->

## Example
```tsx
// nsx
function Counter({ limit = 100 }: { limit: number }) {
  get count = ion(0);
  <:>
    <button 
      on:click={(){ count++ }}
      disabled={(count === limit)@}
    >
      {count@}
    </button>
  </:>
}
```
```tsx
// tsx equivalent
function Counter({ limit = 100 }: { limit: number }) {
  const count = ion(0);
  return <>
    <button 
      on:click={() => count.value++}
      disabled={() => count() === limit}
    >
      {count}
    </button>
  </>
}
```

## Design Principles

### Conceptual elegance and predictability
When language rules are simple and consistent, code is less bug-prone and less mentally taxing to read and write. As a language extension, NoriScript strives to remain coherent with its foundational languages and preserve predictable behavior.

—

### Pragmatic syntactic elegance
NoriScript offers syntactic elegance when it allows developers to read and write code with less friction, improving readability and developer ergonomics. Conciseness, however, should never get in the way of language consistency and predictability.

—

### Principled magic, not spookiness
NoriScript introduces new syntax carefully, favoring explicitness whenever possible. It allows implicit behavior only when that behavior is locally deducible and provides sufficient ergonomic benefit to justify the added language complexity.

The goal is not to avoid magic altogether, but to avoid *unaccountable* magic: behavior that feels arbitrary, exceptional, or difficult to reason about.

## Monospace font recommendations
Because NoriScript makes use of an `@` postfix in its syntax, some developers may prefer fonts with a less visually dominant `@` glyph. Fonts that pair well with NoriScript’s `@` syntax include:
- SF Mono (Apple’s system monospace font)
- Space Mono
- IBM Plex Mono
- Cascadia Mono
- JetBrains Mono
- Commit Mono
- Fira Code
