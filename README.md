# Luent

Luent is a web framework designed around conceptual coherence, expressiveness, and clarity. It consists of a reactivity system, rendering engine, and JSX transpiler, all written from scratch with much tender loving care and obsessive experimentation.

Core features:
- a unified system of fine-grained reactivity
- state management through familiar native structures
- type-explicit reactivity

Experimental features (in progress):
- compile-time mutation-safety checking
- [NoriScript](https://github.com/rubiments/luent/blob/main/packages/noriscript#noriscript)(.ns/.nsx), a language extension of TypeScript + JSX with improved readability and type safety of signal/getter-based reactivity

<br>

> **This project is in early development.** Most core client-side functionality is working and relatively stable, but bugs, rough edges, and some amount of experimental churn should be expected.

<br>

<!-- ## Quick Start
```sh
npm create luent
``` -->

## Example
<!-- Take a tour of Luent's syntax and APIs with these [code glimpses]() and [demos](). -->
```tsx
// tsx
function Counter() {
  const $count = ion(0);
  return <>
    <button on:click={() => $count.value++}>
      {$count}
    </button>
  </>
}
```
> Note: The $ prefix is a naming convention for state accessor functions and/or wrapper objects, not a reactivity marker. Reactivity exists independently of this convention.

```tsx
// nsx
function Counter() {
  get count = ion(0);
  <:>
    <button on:click={(){ count++ }}>
      {count@}
    </button>
  </:>
}
```
> NoriScript (.ns/.nsx) is currently preview-only, not ready for use.

<br>

## Motivation
Modern frameworks have brought powerful innovations to web development, but have also introduced cognitive overhead through syntax, abstractions, and patterns that run counter to native web technologies and developer intuition.

This project explores ways to improve the clarity and consistency of complex, evolving codebases for human developers and coding agents alike.

## JSX Transpiler

Luent transpiles JSX tags into `jsx()` calls with straightforward mental mapping between JSX syntax and compiled output. It extends the base JSX transform with the following:
- JSX slots (known as `children` in classic JSX) are normalized to JSX array factories so that parent nodes may be created before their descendants
- JSX flow expressions (JSX call expressions that form a control flow series) are compiled into a single series node. This could be done at runtime, but Luent takes care of this at compile time to reduce runtime overhead
<!-- - [JSX flow expressions](http://luent.dev/guide/template-control-flow) (JSX call expressions that form a control flow series) are compiled into a single series node. This could be done at runtime, but Luent takes care of this at compile time to reduce runtime overhead -->
- JSX flow slots (the final argument of a JSX flow expression) are also normalized to JSX array factories
- JSX fragments are transformed into arrays

Example:
```jsx
<>
  <h1>Home</h1>
  <Parent foo={foo} bar={bar()} on:click={logClick}>
    <Child />
    {If(active, 
      <div class='msg'>Hello world! - {name}</div>
    )}
    {Else(
      <div class='msg'>zzzzzz</div>
    )}
  </Parent>
</>
```

... essentially maps to:
```jsx
[
  jsx('h1', { Slot: () => ['Home']}),
  jsx(Parent, { foo: foo, bar: bar(), 'on:click': logClick,
    Slot: () => [
      jsx(Child),
      IfSeries(
        If(active, () => [
          jsx('div', { Slot: () => ['Hello world! - ', name]})
        ]),
        Else(() => [
          jsx('div', { Slot: () => ['zzzzzz']})
        ])
      )
    ]
  })
]

```

## Roadmap

Our current goal is to establish clear, consistent, and expressive APIs that enhance developer productivity and application maintainability.

Once the API stabilizes, development will increasingly focus on runtime efficiency, tree-shakability, smaller bundle sizes, and shifting more work from runtime to compile time.

### Completed
- Core client-side functionality
- npm package
- CLI

### In progress
- API refinement and stabilization
- Test coverage
- NoriScript transpiler and language services
- Mutation safety
- Async rendering
- Animation and transition APIs
- Debugging tools
- Documentation
- Server-side rendering
- Interactive islands

### Planned: Framework features
- Scoped styles
- Client-side routing
- Async context

### Planned: Tooling and developer experience
- Improved dev warnings
- HMR refinement
- Playground

### Planned: Runtime performance
- Performance optimizations
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Compiler-assisted tree-shaking

## Acknowledgments

Luent builds upon ideas pioneered by frameworks that have shaped modern web development. It draws inspiration from the consistency of React, the intuitiveness of Vue, the aesthetics of Svelte, the insightfulness of Solid, and the thoroughness of Angular.

Particular acknowledgement to the people and projects I've especially admired:

- Vue 3, the framework I fell in love with and that sparked my fascination with frontend frameworks. Its getter-based reactivity and seeds of fine-grained reactivity heavily influenced Luent's reactivity system.
- Solid.js, which provided insight particularly in how to approach component props and derivations in a signals-based framework
- Ryan Carniato, whose articles and streams have been an encouraging source of clarity and affirmation
- Evan You and the Vue team, whose dedication to developer experience has greatly informed how I approach designing Luent
